Site Features

User Authentication and Initial Setup: 
  Users can create an account and log in. During initial login, they are required to select their favorite genre, favorite movie, and favorite show.

Home Screen: 
  After login, the home screen directly displays movie and TV show recommendations.

Persistent Recommendations: 
  If the user logs out or closes the browser without rating or showing interest in a recommendation, the same recommendation will appear again until an action is taken.

Movie List: 
  Users can browse a list of movies fetched from the TMDb API.

Movie Ratings and Interest: 
  For every recommendation, users must select a rating and interest ("watched," "want to watch," or "not interested").

Recommendations: 
  The system will provide movie and TV show recommendations based on user interactions and initial selections. These recommendations are powered by TensorFlow.js.
